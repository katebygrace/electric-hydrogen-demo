Reflect on overall security for the grafana setup, and how to keep it secure. 

For example, how should we securely connect to data sources? 
Data sources should be behind a VPN, ideally in a private subnet.  
Data sources should be encryted at rest (volumes encryted, as well as databases). 
Connections to databases should be encrypted as well (encryption in transit).  


How should we handle authentication and authorization? 
I would hope to utilize the company's SSO or Active Directory so as not to reinvent the wheel. 
As for authorization, access should be limited to those who need to be able to access those dashboards. 
Ideally there'd already be groups in place we could utilize for RBAC. 

What are some ways we might approach multi-tenancy if multiple organizations need to use this grafana setup, and what would be the pros and cons of each from a security and maintenance perspective? 
Hopefully, depending on the use case, I would utilize Grafana's built in multitenancy function https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/multi-tenancy/
Optionally, if it was necessary to have different Grafana instances, one for each organization, I would convert most of the existing terraform into a module that could easily be re-used.  

What else should we be thinking about to keep the grafana setup secure?
I'd want to do a more thorough review of logging to make sure logs are occurring at every layer of the stack, ideally pipe that into a SIEM of some kind for further analysis. 
I'd want to make sure to keep the database up-to-date. 
I'd want to make sure the docker image stays up to date and is calling the latest base image. 
I'd want to make sure backups are on an adequate cadence - I believe RDS takes snapshots every 24 hours, I might want to increase that frequency. 
I'd want to make sure Grafana and any other running applications stay up to date.
